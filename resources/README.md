# Data
## Notice
In this folder the raw data for the songs is stored.

We have tried different formats like xml, csv, tsv. Furhtermore, we tried to fill the database using only URI in the files and collecting data from REST API or spotipy library. Sometimes, there was data with no audio features but artist names, so we had to collect only a fraction from the web. You can find some data examples in open-data/ folder.
